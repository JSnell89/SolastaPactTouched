Feature/&AHWarlockEldritchInvocationBeguilingInfluenceDescription You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. Mod note, don't take this if you already have proficiency in them :).
Feature/&AHWarlockEldritchInvocationAgnoizingBlastTitle Agonizing blast
Feature/&AHWarlockEldritchInvocationAgnoizingBlastDescription This invocation does nothing, it's intended that you take the Agonizing blast cantrip at level 1 and this at level 2 since there doesn't seem to be a good way to override a cantrip in a casters list.
Feature/&AHWarlockEldritchInvocationRepellingBlastTitle Repelling blast
Feature/&AHWarlockEldritchInvocationRepellingBlastDescription When you hit a creature with eldritch blast, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.  Mod note - This gives a free at will power to push a creature 10ft, try not to cheat with it and use it against targets you hit with Eldritch blast only :).  Adding in a whole new reaction choice on eldritch blast hitting would be crazy to implement.
Feature/&AHWarlockEldritchInvocationThirstingBladeTitle Thirsting blade
Feature/&AHWarlockEldritchInvocationThirstingBladeDescription You can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. (Supposed to have a Prerequisite of Pact of the blade, but it's not enforced).

Feat/&AHWarlockShortRestSpellFeatureTitle Pact magic
Feat/&AHWarlockShortRestSpellFeatureDescription Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.  You regain spell slots on short rest and Charisma determines your spellcasting ability.  Mod note - Warlock spell slots are supposed to only be of the highest level they know, however Solasta doesn't recognize higher spell levels if there are no slots for lower levels (e.g. you can't have only level 2 slots).  As a current workaround you get 1 slot of each lower level slot that you should not use as it would be considered cheating :).

Subclass/&AHWarlockSubclassFiendPactDescription You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.

Feature/&AHWarlockFiendPactDarkOnesOwnLuckTitle Dark One's Own Luck
Feature/&AHWarlockFiendPactDarkOnesOwnLuckDescription You gain an indomitable use once per day (Choice to re-roll saving throw if you fail).  (Doesn't match SRD but would require a whole new reaction ability to emulate the SRD).
Feature/&AHWarlockFiendPactFiendishResilienceTitle Fiendish Resilience
Feature/&AHWarlockFiendPactFiendishResilienceDescription You gain resistance to fire damage.  (Not same as SRD - I believe the proper implementation would require a power for every damage type with a shared resource pool as there doesn't seem to be a way to group power choices like spells right now).
